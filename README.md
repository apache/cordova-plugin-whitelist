# cordova-plugin-legacy-whitelist

This plugin implements the Cordova 3.6 Whitelist policy for Cordova 4.0.
Please use cordova-plugin-whitelist instead, as it's more secure.

Supported on:
- cordova-android@4.0.0
- cordova-ios@4.0.0

## Usage:
Use `<access>` tags, just as in previous versions of Cordova.
